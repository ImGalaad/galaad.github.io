### Introduction
Hi! I'm going to introduce you to the world of computers, so don't worry, we'll take it step by step. It's a complex but fascinating world. As in any field, when we first get to the bottom of it, we get the impression that it's too difficult, but if we take it one step at a time, it all becomes clear.

I'm not here to tell you what the best path is... **Learning is different for everyone**.

So I'm going to recommend some tools and sources, there are thousands of ways to do a single thing in computing, find the one you're most comfortable with and go at your own speed.

### Your system
First of all, you need a computer, by definition, a computer is “an automatic machine for processing information”, so a tablet or a phone works too :)
