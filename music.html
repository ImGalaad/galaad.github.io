            I am an avid classical music lover, and my favorite composers are Litvinovsky, Jenkins, Albéniz, Vivaldi,
            Piazzolla, Mozart, Dvořák, Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Bach and Beethoven. Each of these composers
            has their own history and style, but what unites them is their ability to create works of breathtaking
            beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among my favorite pieces by Litvinovsky would be "Tales of the Magic Tree: XI. Fascinated by the Rain" which
            is a beautiful piece of classical music that touches me every time I hear it. From Jenkins, I recommend
            "Concerto Grosso for Strings "Palladio": I. Allegretto" a piece of contemporary classical music that is both
            moving and powerful. "Suite Española No. 1: V. Asturias - Leyenda" by Albéniz is another of my favorite
            pieces, it is rich in color and emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
            From Vivaldi, I recommend "The Four Seasons" which is a classical music staple, each season is beautifully
            represented in this work. "Libertango" by Piazzolla is another favorite piece of mine, it is a classical
            tango that is both mesmerizing and passionate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mozart, Dvořák, Tchaikovsky, Mendelssohn, Schubert, Bach, and Beethoven are all incredibly talented
            composers and each of them have works that I highly recommend, such as Mozart's "Introitus. Requiem "
            "Symphony No. 9 "From the New World": IV" by Dvořák (a great classic), "Symphony No. 4 Finale" by
            Tchaikovsky, "Symphony No. 4 "Italian": IV. Saltarello. Presto" by Mendelssohn, "Presto - Prestissimo" by
            Schubert, "Adagio" by Bach, and "Piano Sonata No. 14 "Moonlight Sonata": III" by Beethoven.
        </p>
