By introducing advanced utilities like error handling, smart memory management, data structures, and macros for loops and type safety, C+ brings C development closer to the standards of modern systems languages like Rust and Zig, all while staying true to C’s lightweight, performance-oriented core.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/ImSumire/Cp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Repository</a> <a href="/blog/c+/introduction">Docs</a></p><h2>Emoria</h2><p>Emoria is an immersive, survival-based isometric game drawing inspiration from Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Animal Crossing, and Minecraft. Players can expect a blend of exploration, building, farming, and survival mechanics within a visually captivating, interactive world. While the graphical style is still being finalized, the aim is to combine the detailed aesthetic of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219390/The_Ballad_of_Bellum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballad of Bellum</a> while retaining pixel-art feel of <a href="https://github.com/ImSumire/SpicyJourney" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spicy Journey</a>, creating a unique look that merges modern game art with nostalgic pixelated graphics.</p><h2>Floral</h2><p>Floral is a beginner-friendly programming language designed to introduce foundational programming concepts through a minimalist syntax and a straightforward environment. Floral supports essential features like polymorphism, compile-time memory management using a borrowing and ownership model, and requires no runtime garbage collection, making it both efficient and accessible. It combines simplicity with power, aiming to empower new developers to create and understand complex programs without the overhead of more advanced languages.</p><p>Inspirated by <a href="https://nim-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nim</a> and <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a></p><h2>Radiance</h2><p>Radiance is a lightweight, low-level game engine designed for developers seeking complete control over their projects. Built on Rust for unmatched safety and performance, and powered by Raylib for simple and efficient rendering, Radiance emphasizes clarity, modularity, and speed.</p><p>Features include:</p><ul><li>Flexible Scene Management: Supports manual Just-in-Time and At-Start resource loading for controllability and performance.</li><li>Modern and Minimalist Design: Rust's type system ensures safe, fast, and concurrent gameplay mechanics.</li><li>Modern Utils: Networking, Physics, Pathfinding, UI, ECS and more.</li><li>Modular Architecture: Easily extendable using external crates.</li></ul></main></body></html>
